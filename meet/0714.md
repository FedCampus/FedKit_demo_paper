## Ideas on specific implementations

### Workout reminder generative transformer (`FedCampus_APP`)

Train on past time + workload data and predict future workload.

Personalization: infer on users' past data and generate future data.

Usage: analyze the users' predicted future data and remind the user to work out
at the probable time, simply stated.

## ML model deployment pipeline

- CLI app in Python that uses REST API requests to upload models.
- Server execute `.tflite`/CoreML model generation code.
