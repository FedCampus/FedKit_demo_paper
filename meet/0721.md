# Prioritize launching `FedCampus_APP`; FedMCRNN

- Steven Explored Flutter and saw it a valid option to speed up UI and
    cross-platform development.
- Beilong switched from making a transformer model to FedMCRNN and
    almost completed data collection.
- Johnny learning iOS basics while having CHSC.

Aside: FedMCRNN can be a serious extension project,
as Steven has talked to Aicha.
