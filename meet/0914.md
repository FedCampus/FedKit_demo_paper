## `coremltools` Disaster

Needed to convert TensorFlow model to Core ML.

- Latest `coremltools` version 6 does not work

    `Dense` → `MatMul`—not updatable
- Older `coremltools` require older `keras` that don't support Apple silicon.
- Version 4.1 introduces dependency hell together with `tensorflow` & `keras`.
- Test VM is broken.
