We forgot to cite \[4\] when mentioning the Flower FL Framework. Adding.

We removed the mentioning that it is undocumented. Adding that back.

### **Demo Submission Reviews 2**

> The paper does not discuss how platform differences might affect model

Because we did not explore that.

> and the YouTube demo provided is inaccessible.

Fixed by using `hyperref`.

### **Demo Submission Reviews 3**

> It is unclear how the version of the OS in cross-platform affects the

### **Demo Submission Reviews 4**

> Not enough benchmarks are compared with. The live demonstration only

### **Demo Submission Reviews 5**

> - The authors only provided results on an Android device and an iOS

This demo is not (yet) a benchmark.

> - It is better that Fig. 3 is to show training progress rather than a
>     photo illustrating the setup.

Unclear how we can show the training progress in a photoâ€¦
We only have these photos.
