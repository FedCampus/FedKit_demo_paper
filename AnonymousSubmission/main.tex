\section{Introduction}
The most appealing area of application for FL is mobile devices.
Yet, we could not find enough support for our real-world cross-platform mobile
FL research.
So, we purposefully built FedKit to power our mobile app for FL research.

\section{System Description}

\newcommand{\model}{$M$}
\newcommand{\fs}{$S_F$}

\subsection{Features}

\subsubsection{General Approachability}
FedKit allows ML researchers to develop ML models to target mobile devices
using Python libraries that they are already familiar with.
We integrate TensorFlow Lite to support Android training and Core ML for iOS
training,
both of which support converting models from popular libraries such as Pytorch,
TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn.
% FIX: This is not that true about iOS.

\subsubsection{Backend-Oriented Model Deployment}
Researchers can deploy new models simply from the Backend,
without the need to update the mobile apps.
Most FL frameworks assume a fixed ML model that is bundled with the app,
making it difficult to iterate on the ML models.
By moving to our Backend the responsibility to choose which ML model to train,
we make it trivial to deploy new models that take the same kind of inputs and
outputs as the old one.

\subsubsection{Full Model Checkpointing}
On every round of training an ML model \model,
all the parameters of \model{} is saved to the Backend database.
When \model{} is used for the next session of training,
its latest checkpoint is restored.

\subsubsection{Optional Telemetry}
On each round of training and evaluation,
we allow optional telemetry information to be sent to the Backend.
This includes the timing and loss,
associated with the FL session and the participants' ID.
This extra information helps FL researchers observe and analyze
the performance of their models.

\subsection{FL Workflow}

\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw, minimum height=4cm] at (0, 0) {App};
    \node[draw, minimum height=4cm] at (6, 0) {Backend};
    \draw[-stealth] (0.5, 1.5) node[above right]{Requests for ML model} --
                    (5.0, 1.5);
    \draw[stealth-] (0.5, 1.4) -- node[below right]{ML model \model}
                    (5.0, 1.4);
    \draw[-stealth] (0.5, 0.0) node[above right]{Requests to train \model} --
                    (5.0, 0.0);
    \draw[stealth-] (0.5,-0.1) -- node[below]{Flower server to train \model}
                    (5.0,-0.1);
    \draw[stealth-] (4.5,-1.0) node[below left, draw]{FL server \fs} --
                    (5.0,-0.1);
    \draw[stealth-stealth] (0.5,-1.2) node[above right]{Train \model} --
                           (2.1,-1.2);
    \draw[-stealth] (0.5,-1.7) node[below right]{Training telemetry} --
                    (5.0,-1.7);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{FL workflow}
\label{fig:fl-workflow}
\end{figure}

Mobile clients fetch ML models from the Backend Server before doing FL.
This workflow allows Backend-oriented model deployment, where researches can
deploy new ML models simply by uploading them to the Backend,
without updating the client mobile apps.

\subsubsection{Data Type}
Each client has its Data Type, the shape of its training input and label,
predefined.
This makes sense because obtaining each client's training data requires
implementation specific to that client.

\subsubsection{Model Request}
Clients provide the Backend their Data Type and request for an ML model \model.

\subsubsection{Training Initiation}
Clients request the Backend to start training \model.
The Backend spawns an FL Server \fs{} and responds directs clients to it.

\subsubsection{Training}
Clients connect to \fs{} and participate in FL with their local data.
\fs{} schedules the training, aggregation and evaluation for \model;
it also sends aggregated parameters to the Backend for analysis.
Clients send telemetry about timing and loss to the Backend.

\subsection{Implementation}

We offer an example Flutter client implementation that supports both Android and
iOS, and a separate Kotlin Android client.

The clients make JSON APIs calls to the Backend,
and gRPC calls to FL Servers.
For that, we offer a Flutter package and a Kotlin package.

The Backend Server is designed as a persistent orchestrator service.

On-device training is especially difficult because mobile devices have limited
compute power.
To achieve optimal performance, our implementation adopts native
solutions---TensorFlow Lite on Android and Core ML on iOS.
We offer an Android package for on-device training and a Python package for
TensorFlow Lite model conversion from any Keras model.

We leverage Flower \cite{beutel2020flower} for FL Servers.
