\begin{abstract}
    We present FedKit, a federated learning (FL) system tailored for
    cross-platform FL research on Android and iOS devices.
    FedKit pipelines FL development by
    enabling Python-based machine learning (ML) model conversion,
    native performance training with unified APIs,
    and cross-platform model aggregation.
    Our FL workflow supports flexible ML operations (MLOps) in production,
    facilitating continuous model delivery and training.
    We have deployed FedKit in a research app,
    achieving significant milestones.
    The code is open-source at \url{https://github.com/FedCampus/FedKit}.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Federated learning (FL) enables edge devices to
collaboratively train a shared machine learning (ML) model while
retaining private data on device \cite{mcmahan2017communication}.
Smartphones, rich in sensitive data,
are promising candidates for FL.
Nevertheless, most existing FL frameworks
\cite[e.g.,][]{bonawitz2019towards,liu2021fate,ma2019paddlepaddle,openfl_citation}
primarily cater to simulation,
limiting their practical use on smartphones.

Several FL frameworks have emerged to fulfill on-smartphone FL,
but still exhibit limitations,
as summarized in Table~\ref{tbl:fn-frameworks}.
Specifically, FedML \cite{he2020fedml},
Project Florida \cite{madrigal2023project},
and FedScale \cite{lai2022fedscale} primarily support Android.
On the other hand,
Flower \cite{beutel2020flower,mathur2021ondevice} and
Syft \cite{ryffel2018generic,Ziller2021,hall2021syft}
provide SDKs for both Android and iOS.
However, Flower SDKs lack the capability for cross-platform aggregation,
while Syft lacks hardware acceleration for training.

In addition to seamless cross-platform support,
continuous deployment in production is crucial.
While FedML and Florida support ML operations (MLOps),
their proprietary services limit full customization.
In contrast, open-source solutions like Flower and Syft enable
full customization
but are more suitable for one-shot experiments rather than continuous deployment.

\subsubsection{Contributions}
We developed FedKit,
a versatile FL system designed to enable \textbf{cross-platform} FL research on
\textbf{Android and iOS}:
\begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$]
    \item FedKit provides \textbf{modularized libraries} to train
        Python-based models on Android and iOS and
        aggregate across platforms.
        These libraries can serve as a foundational resource for
        on-device ML systems.
    \item We introduce a novel FL workflow in FedKit,
        enabling flexible \textbf{MLOps} from
        the backend in production.
        This innovation encourages other open-source solutions to
        rival proprietary services in deployment support.
\end{enumerate}

\section{System Description}

FedKit facilitates FL among Android and iOS clients (mobile apps),
coordinated by a single Backend server.
Each client trains a local model with private data,
and the Backend performs cross-platform aggregation of these local models to update the global model.
Specifically, FedKit introduces two key innovations: 
\circled{1} A cross-platform (Android-iOS) FL pipeline centered around ML models.
\circled{2} Flexible MLOps to enable efficient FL research iteration in production.

\subsection{Cross-Platform FL Model Pipeline}

To enable cross-platform FL,
especially \textit{cross-platform aggregation},
we propose a pipeline comprising
\textit{model conversion} and
\textit{unified training APIs},
as shown in Fig.~\ref{cross_fl}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=\linewidth]{cross_smart_fl_workflow.pdf}
    \caption{FedKit Model Pipeline for Cross-Platform FL.}
    \label{cross_fl}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Model Conversion}
We begin by converting Python-based models into formats compatible with
Android (TensorFlow Lite or TFLite) and iOS (Core ML).
Core ML defines a fixed model structure and provides
official converter CoreMLTools.
For TFLite, we standardized a model format with four essential FL methods
(\lstinline{train}, \lstinline{infer}, \lstinline{parameters},
and \lstinline{restore}),
and developed a TensorFlow converter in Python targeting this format.

\subsubsection{Unified Training APIs}
FedKit's TFLite Trainer and Core ML Trainer leverage corresponding frameworks to
locally train the converted models on device,
utilizing GPU and NPU acceleration.
Both trainers expose unified APIs for
retrieving and setting parameters,
fitting, and evaluation.
On Android, these APIs invoke the TFLite interpreter to call
our standardized methods defined in Model Conversion.
However, on iOS, our experimentation revealed that
Core ML \textit{forbids} directly setting parameters, which could potentially impede FL.
To overcome this constraint,
we modify the underlying ProtoBuf representations of
Core ML models.
We employ Swift code generated from the relevant ProtoBuf definition files. This code allows us to navigate nested model definitions and access parameters on iPhones, thus enabling smooth FL operations on iOS devices.


\subsubsection{Cross-Platform Aggregation}
The primary challenge in cross-platform aggregation lies in
the need for \textit{uniform parameter representations}, 
where both trainers retrieve and set parameters as byte arrays,
following the order of model layers.
To achieve this uniformity,  we employed separate strategies:
1) For Android, 
the TFLite interpreter only accepts inputs and outputs as maps from \textit{names} to
\textit{tensors}.
During \textit{Model Conversion},
we automatically assign numerical names to
each layer of parameters based on their indices.
This naming conversion allows access during training.
2) For iOS,
conversely, Core ML permits \textit{only} certain \textit{updatable layers} and
we can only access the updatable layers' parameters after training.
To obtain other layers' parameters,
we extract them using ProtoBuf access.
Additionally, for layer information retrieval,
we record the layer names generated by CoreMLTools during Model Conversion and
utilize them during training.

\subsection{Flexible MLOps in Production}
\newcommand{\model}{$M$}
\newcommand{\fs}{$S_\mathrm F$}
FedKit empowers researchers to continuously develop models and algorithms and
deploy them in production.
Our three-step FL workflow, illustrated in (Fig.~\ref{fig:fl-workflow}),
leverages our self-hosted and directly controlled Backend.
In the following sections, we will elaborate on how these steps facilitate the integration of MLOps in production.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=0.8\linewidth]{fl_workflow.pdf}
    \caption{FedKit FL Workflow.}
    \label{fig:fl-workflow}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Continuous Cross-Platform Model Delivery}
Traditionally, models for on-device training are \textit{embedded} into client apps.
This approach couples model delivery with app updates, 
resulting in complexities when submitting apps to app stores and garnering user adoption.


Conversely,
FedKit enables \textit{continuous model delivery without app updates}.
This is achieved by decoupling models from clients through the Model Request, which enables model delivery through uploads to the Backend.
Specifically, clients request the Backend for a model suitable for
their platform (Android/iOS) and training data type.
The Backend selects the appropriate model \model{} from the database and
provides detailed model information.
Consequently, clients download the TFLite or Core ML model that aligns with
their platforms,
enabling seamless cross-platform model delivery.

\subsubsection{Customizable Continuous FL Training}
FedKit manages continuous FL training by allowing multiple parallel FL Servers
through FL Server Setup.
When clients request for an FL Server to
train their chosen model \model{},
the Backend either reuses a suitable FL Server \fs{} if it exists,
or spawns a new one.
Each FL Server
operates as an independent Python subprocess of the Django Backend,
occupying its own port.
Clients connect to \fs{}'s port for FL Training.
This dynamic approach ensures that
newly delivered models can be immediately trained with new FL Servers
without interfering with ongoing ones.
Furthermore, to enhance adaptability and customization, we have integrated FL Servers with the Flower FL Framework. This choice empowers our platform with robust scheduling capabilities for training and evaluation tasks, providing flexibility and enabling the customization of FL algorithms using Python.


\section{Use Case: FedCampus}

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics*[width=0.7\linewidth]{fedcampus_demo.pdf}
    \caption{FedCampus Experiment Setup.}
    \label{fig:fedcampus}
\end{figure}

We present a practical use case of FedKit, FedCampus,
a campus-based FL experiment.
Our research app, powered by FedKit,
conducts cross-platform FL with a sleep-efficiency prediction model
akin to \cite{khoa2022fedmcrnn}.

In the FedCampus experiment setup (Fig.~\ref{fig:fedcampus}),
we deployed a self-hosted Backend in the background,
with real-time logs and loss displayed on a connected laptop.
Our Flutter app collected exercise data from smartwatches
though Huawei HealthKit on the Android phone and Apple Health on the iPhone.
Notably, hardware acceleration kept both smartphones cool during training.
The outcome was a significant reduction in the model's training loss,
confirming FedKit's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
