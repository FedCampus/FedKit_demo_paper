\section{Introduction}

% TODO: Come back after finishing Conclusion.

TODO

FedKit presents the following key highlights:

\begin{enumerate*}[label=\arabic*)]
    \item Academic Research: FedKit enables FL academic research to test FL algorithms using real-world data from diverse smartphone platforms, providing valuable insights under real-world circumstances.
    \item Industry Application: FedKit allows the industry to harness the vast amount of data available on smartphones for FL applications, offering potential improvements in various domains.
\end{enumerate*}.

% TODO: Chart of FL frameworks' platform support.

\section{System Description}

FedKit is a sophisticated client-server FL system that leverages a robust Backend as the server, complemented by \textit{cross-platform smartphones} as clients.
% TODO: Figure of system structure.
The clients perform local training on private on-mobile data and collaboratively contribute to the training of the global model under the Backend's supervision.
Despite the system's apparent simplicity and elegance, implementing a mobile-based FL system introduces specific challenges due to the intricacies of cross-platform mobile development.
To address these challenges, we propose FedKit to support cross-platform on-smartphone FL that emphasizes two key aspects that distinguish it from existing solutions:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\arabic*)]
    \item cross-smartphone-platform FL support using
        native smartphone ML frameworks, and
    \item flexible FL customization in production enabled by
        our custom FL workflow
\end{enumerate*}.

\subsection{Cross-Smartphone-Platform FL}

FedKit introduces a novel approach to FL on smartphones
with different operating systems.
It simplifies on-smartphone FL for researchers by empowering them to
use Python to
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\arabic*)]
    \item create ML models to train on different smartphone platforms at
        native performance, and
    \item schedule FL and aggregate models across
        heterogeneous smartphone platforms
\end{enumerate*}.
The primary challenges that block existing solutions from
achieving cross-smartphone-platform FL are
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\arabic*)]
    \item the foreignness in cross-platform mobile development and
    \item the complexity in on-smartphone ML training
\end{enumerate*}.
To overcome the above challenges, we propose a three-step approach:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item Convert the ML models from desktop ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow)
        into formats natively supported by each smartphone platform,
    \item Build a unified interface to run the converted models on smartphones
        using native ML frameworks, and
    \item Aggregate model parameters across platforms using a unified format
\end{enumerate*}.

% TODO: Figure of ML model conversion.
FedKit's implementation does the heavy-lifting by leveraging
native mobile ML frameworks, specifically,
Google's TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) on Android and Apple's Core ML on iOS.
These frameworks are chosen for their superior utilization of GPUs and NPUs,
which are essential for accelerating training on resource-constrained smartphones.
The drawback is that they impose unique and intricate challenges,
so we had to employ exotic solutions to handle them.
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\arabic*)]
    \item TFLite Model Standardization:
        A TFLite model is a collection of user-defined methods to be run on
        its interpreter.
        To provide a unified training interface and simplify model construction,
        we standardize four methods
        (read and update parameters, train, and infer),
        and utilizing them to implement FL on Android.
        Additionally, to free researchers from manually implementing and
        converting TFLite models,
        we provide a Python converter that supports any TensorFlow models.
    \item Core ML Jail-Break:
        Core ML models have defined forms and an official Python converter.
        However, in our experiments, we confirmed that
        Core ML disallows setting model parameters,
        which makes FL impossible.
        To overcome this restriction, we manually alter
        Core ML models' underlying ProtoBuf representations to
        update their parameters and configure the training data
\end{enumerate*}.

Our approaches not only result in unified native training APIs on
both Android and iOS, but also
allow for seamless cross-platform aggregation.
To aggregate local models from different platforms,
we carefully represent model parameters in a unified format by
sequentially retrieving each layer's parameters as a byte array.

\subsection{Flexible In-Production FL Customization}
\newcommand{\model}{$M$}
\newcommand{\fs}{$S_\mathrm F$}
We provide the flexibility to customize ML models and FL algorithms
in production.
This is crucial because, to iterate on ML models and explore new FL algorithms,
researchers must have the ability to change them.
However, customizing on-smartphone FL in production is difficult because
we cannot modify the client apps without an app update,
which suffers from app stores' slow review processes and
users' slow reaction to update their apps.
Most FL frameworks simply ignore this problem and
hard-code the ML models into the app.
Instead, we shift responsibilities to the Backend in our FL workflow,
utilizing our full control over the Backend to
maximize the potential of FL customization,
which we detail next.

Our FL workflow provides extra flexibility in FL customization in production by
shifting as many responsibilities to the Backend as possible.
First, we can deploy new ML models from the Backend because
it is responsible to decide which model to train.
% TODO: Figure of structure with workflow, numbered.
As shown in Fig. , % TODO: ref
clients start by requesting the Backend for an ML model \model{} that fits
their platform and the kind of training data they have.
They then initiate the training by requesting the Backend for
an FL Server \fs{} for \model{}
(Fig. ). % TODO: ref
FL Server \fs{} is a Python subprocesses of the Backend and
utilizes the Flower FL Framework to
schedule training and evaluation in the FL process.
Here, the Backend is responsible to track different FL sessions and
decide whether
to spawn new FL Servers or let new clients join existing ones.
This design isolates each FL session,
so we can federate learning multiple models simultaneously, and
users would be able to customize the FL process for each model.
We chose Python, Django, and Flower to implement the Backend so that
FL researchers can customize it using the language they are familiar with.
By simply uploading new ML models and
changing the FL algorithm code in Python,
researchers can flexibly customize the FL process in production.
