\begin{abstract}
    We present FedKit, a federated learning (FL) system tailored for
    cross-platform experiments on Android and iOS devices.
    FedKit pipelines FL development by
    enabling Python-based machine learning (ML) model conversion,
    native performance training with unified APIs,
    and cross-platform model aggregation.
    Our FL workflow supports flexible ML operations (MLOps) in production,
    facilitating continuous model delivery and training.
    We have deployed FedKit in a research app,
    achieving significant milestones.
    The code is open-source at \url{https://github.com/FedCampus/FedKit}.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Federated learning (FL) enables edge devices to
collaboratively train a shared machine learning (ML) model while
retaining private data on device \cite{mcmahan2017communication}.
Smartphones, rich in sensitive data,
are promising candidates for FL.
Nevertheless, most existing FL frameworks
\cite[e.g.,][]{bonawitz2019towards,liu2021fate,ma2019paddlepaddle,openfl_citation}
primarily cater to simulation,
limiting their practical use on smartphones.

Several FL frameworks have emerged to fulfill on-smartphone FL,
but still exhibit limitations,
as summarized in Table~\ref{tbl:fn-frameworks}.
Specifically, FedML \cite{he2020fedml},
Project Florida \cite{madrigal2023project},
and FedScale \cite{lai2022fedscale} primarily support Android.
Flower \cite{beutel2020flower,mathur2021ondevice} and
PySyft \cite{ryffel2018generic,Ziller2021,hall2021syft}
provide SDKs for both platforms,
but Flower SDKs lack across-platform aggregation,
and PySyft's training approach lacks hardware acceleration.

In addition to seamless cross-platform support,
continuous deployment is crucial.
FedML and Florida support ML operations (MLOps) in production settings,
but their proprietary services limit full customization.
In contrast, open-source solutions like Flower and PySyft enable
full customization,
but are more suitable for one-shot experiments.

\subsubsection{Contributions}
We developed FedKit,
a versatile FL system designed to enable \textbf{cross-platform} FL research on
\textbf{Android and iOS}:
\begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$]
    \item FedKit provides \textbf{modularized libraries} to train
        Python-based models on Android and iOS and
        aggregate across platforms.
        These libraries can serve as a foundational resource for
        on-device ML systems.
    \item We introduce a novel FL workflow in FedKit,
        enabling flexible \textbf{MLOps} from
        the backend in production.
        This innovation encourages other open-source solutions to
        rival proprietary services in deployment support.
\end{enumerate}

\section{System Description}

FedKit facilitates FL among clients (mobile apps) on Android and iOS platforms,
coordinated by a single Backend server.
Each client trains a local model with private data,
and the Backend aggregates these local models to update the global model.
Specifically, FedKit introduces two key innovations: 
\circled{1} A cross-platform (Android-iOS) FL pipeline centered around ML models.
\circled{2} Flexible MLOps to enable efficient FL research iteration in production.

\subsection{Cross-Platform FL Model Pipeline}

To enable cross-platform FL,
especially \textit{cross-platform aggregation},
we propose a pipeline comprising
\textit{model conversion} and
\textit{unified training APIs},
as shown in Fig.~\ref{cross_fl}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=\linewidth]{cross_smart_fl_workflow.pdf}
    \caption{FedKit Model Pipeline for Cross-Platform FL.}
    \label{cross_fl}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Model Conversion}
We begin by converting Python-based models into formats compatible with
Android (TensorFlow Lite or TFLite) and iOS (Core ML).
Core ML defines a fixed model structure and provides
official converter CoreMLTools.
For TFLite, we standardized the model format and
developed a Python converter for TensorFlow.
Our TFLite models encompass four essential FL methods:
\lstinline{train}, \lstinline{infer}, \lstinline{parameters},
and \lstinline{restore}.

\subsubsection{Unified Training APIs}
FedKit leverage TFLite and Core ML to train the converted models on device,
utilizing GPU and NPU acceleration.
Our trainers expose unified APIs for
retrieving and setting parameters,
fitting, and evaluation.
On Android, these APIs invoke the TFLite interpreter to call
our standardized methods above.
However, on iOS, our experimentation revealed that
Core ML forbids directly setting parameters.
To overcome this constraint that could impede FL,
we modify the underlying ProtoBuf representations of
Core ML models.
Employing Swift code generated from the relevant ProtoBuf definition files,
we navigate nested model definitions and access parameters on iPhones.

\subsubsection{Cross-Platform Aggregation}
The primary challenge in cross-platform aggregation lies in
achieving uniform parameter representations.
Both trainers retrieve and set parameters as byte arrays,
following the order of model layers.
We employed separate strategies to achieve this uniformity.
1)
The TFLite interpreter only accepts inputs and outputs as maps from names to
tensors.
During Model Conversion,
we automatically assign numerical names to
each layer of parameters based on their indices.
This naming conversion allows access during training.
2)
Conversely, Core ML permits only certain layers to be updatable and
provide the parameters of these layers after training.
To obtain parameters for other layers,
we extract them using ProtoBuf access.
Additionally, for layer information retrieval,
we record the layer names generated by CoreMLTools during Model Conversion and
utilize them during training.

\subsection{Flexible MLOps in Production}
\newcommand{\model}{$M$}
\newcommand{\fs}{$S_\mathrm F$}
FedKit empowers researchers to continuously develop models and algorithms and
deploy them in production.
Our three-step FL workflow, illustrated in (Fig.~\ref{fig:fl-workflow}),
leverages our self-hosted and directly controlled Backend.
Below, we explain how these steps enable MLOps in production.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=0.8\linewidth]{fl_workflow.pdf}
    \caption{FedKit FL Workflow.}
    \label{fig:fl-workflow}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Continuous Cross-Platform Model Delivery}
Traditionally, models for on-device training are embedded into client apps,
coupling model delivery with app updates,
leading to complexity in app store submissions and user adoption.
Conversely,
FedKit enables continuous model delivery without app updates.
Model Request decouples models and clients,
enabling model delivery through uploads to the Backend.
In this step, clients request the Backend for a model suitable for
their platform and training data type.
The Backend selects the appropriate model \model{} from its database and
provides detailed model information.
Clients then download the TFLite or Core ML model corresponding to
their platforms,
therefore achieving cross-platform model delivery.

\subsubsection{Customizable Continuous FL Training}
FedKit manages continuous FL training by allowing multiple parallel FL Servers
during FL Server Setup.
Clients request the Backend for an FL Server to
train their chosen model \model{}.
The Backend assigns clients to an existing FL Server \fs{} that
is already training \model{},
or spawns a new one on demand.
Each FL Server \fs{}
operates as the Django Backend's independent Python subprocess,
occupying its own port.
Clients connect to this port for FL Training.
This design ensures that
newly delivered models can immediately be trained with new FL Servers,
without interfering ongoing ones.
Furthermore, these FL Servers employ the Flower FL Framework for
scheduling training and evaluation,
inheriting its flexibility and
allowing FL algorithm customizations in Python.

\section{Use Case: FedCampus}

    \includegraphics*[width=0.7\linewidth]{fedcampus_demo.pdf}
    \caption{FedCampus Experiment Setup.}
    \label{fig:fedcampus}
\end{figure}

We present a practical use case of FedKit, FedCampus,
a campus-based FL experiment.
Our research app, powered by FedKit,
conducts cross-platform FL with a sleep-efficiency prediction model
akin to \cite{khoa2022fedmcrnn}.

In the FedCampus experiment setup (Fig.~\ref{fig:fedcampus}),
we deployed a self-hosted Backend in the background,
with real-time logs and loss displayed on a connected laptop.
Our Flutter app collected exercise data from smartwatches
though Huawei HealthKit on the Android phone and Apple Health on the iPhone.
Notably, hardware acceleration kept both smartphones cool during training.
The outcome was a significant reduction in the model's training loss,
confirming FedKit's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
