FedKit presents the following key highlights:

\begin{enumerate*}[label=\arabic*)]
    \item Academic Research: FedKit enables FL academic research to test FL algorithms using real-world data from diverse smartphone platforms, providing valuable insights under real-world circumstances.
    \item Industry Application: FedKit allows the industry to harness the vast amount of data available on smartphones for FL applications, offering potential improvements in various domains.
\end{enumerate*}.

% TODO: Chart of FL frameworks' platform support.

\section{System Description}

FedKit federates learning among client apps across smartphone platforms and
a single Backend server.
% TODO: Figure of system structure.
Each client trains a local ML model with its private data on the smartphone.
Then, the Backend aggregates these local models to update the global model.

In practice, this system faces significant intricacies in
on-device ML training and mobile development production cycle.
To facilitate cross-platform on-smartphone FL research,
FedKit features two innovations:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\arabic*)]
    \item cross-smartphone-platform FL support using
        native smartphone ML frameworks, and
    \item flexible FL customization in production enabled by
        our custom FL workflow
\end{enumerate*}.

\subsection{Cross-Smartphone-Platform FL}

For an ML model created in Python,
we want to train and aggregate it conveniently across Android and iOS.
We also want to utilize GPUs and NPUs to accelerate training.
For these, we convert the models to supported formats,
train them under unified APIs using smartphone ML frameworks,
and aggregate the parameters in unified representations.

\subsubsection{Model Conversion}
% TODO: Figure of ML model conversion.
We convert TensorFlow models into supported formats,
targeting Google's TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for Android,
and Apple's Core ML for iOS.
Core ML already has a defined model form and an official converter called
CoreMLTools.
For TFLite, we standardized the model form ourselves and
provide a Python converter.
Our standard TFLite models include four necessary methods for FL:
read and update parameters, train, and infer.

\subsubsection{On-Device Training}
With the converted models, we use corresponding frameworks to train them
on smartphones.
For cross-platform support,
we designed a set of unified APIs that both trainers expose,
including functions to get and set parameters, fit and evaluate the model.
On Android, we implement these APIs by indirectly calling
our four standardized methods in the TFLite interpreter.
On iOS, however, we found out in our experiments that
Core ML disallows setting model parameters,
which would make FL impossible.
To jail-break from this restriction, we manually alter
Core ML models' underlying ProtoBuf representations.

\subsubsection{Cross-Platform Aggregation}
Now that we can train the models,
the next step is to aggregate their parameters across platforms.
We carefully design FedKit so the APIs to get and set model parameters
yield the same representation on both platforms.
During model conversion,
the updatable model layers are recorded in the same order.
The training API implementations then sequentially access these layers to
retrieve or insert the parameters as byte arrays.

\subsection{Flexible In-Production FL Customization}
\newcommand{\model}{$M$}
\newcommand{\fs}{$S_\mathrm F$}
After being able to federate learning on smartphones,
the traditional approach would hard-code the model and training procedure
into the client app.
But then, the app would need to be updated every time a change is made,
involving the complication of app stores and users in production.
Instead,
we want to empower FL researchers to conveniently iterate on ML models and
explore new FL algorithms
without updating the app.
Therefore, we propose a three-step FL workflow that
enables customizing ML models and FL algorithms in production.
% TODO: Figure of structure with workflow, numbered.

\subsubsection{Model Request}
Clients request the Backend for an ML model \model{} that fits
their platform and training data type (Fig. ). % TODO: fig.
The Backend decides which model to train based on
available models in its database.
So, FL researchers simply deploy new models in production by uploading them to
the Backend.

\subsubsection{Training Initiation}
Clients request the Backend for an FL Server \fs{} to train \model.
If there exists an FL Server already training \model,
The Backend assigns new clients to it;
otherwise, it spawns a new \fs.
Since FL Servers are the Backend's Python subprocesses,
they allow for multiple simultaneous yet independent FL sessions.
Furthermore, researchers can map each model to a tailored FL Server by
customizing the Backend's Django implementation.

\subsubsection{Training}
Clients participate in regular FL training by connecting to \fs.
These FL Servers leverage the user-friendly Flower FL Framework to
schedule training and evaluation.
They are regular Flower gRPC servers, meaning that
they inherit all of Flower's great flexibility to customize the FL algorithm in
Python.

% TODO: Experiments: the app.
\section{Demonstration}
To demonstrate FedKit in action,
we deployed an app that federates learning using exercise data collected from
smart watches.
% TODO: figure of phones.
This Flutter app trains a sleep-efficiency prediction model similar to ()
%TODO: Cite FedMCRNN
using data obtained from Huawei HealthKit
on Android and Apple Health on iOS.
% TODO: Graph of the app flow.
We had 3 test users who opened the app to train the model at least once a day,
resulting in decreasing training loss.
% TODO: Training telemetry graph. Is loss going down?
