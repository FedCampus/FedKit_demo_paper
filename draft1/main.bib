  abstract  = {PySyft is an open-source multi-language library
               enabling secure and private machine learning by
               wrapping and extending popular deep learning frameworks
               such as PyTorch in a transparent, lightweight, and
               user-friendly manner. Its aim is to both help
               popularize privacy-preserving techniques in machine
               learning by making them as accessible as possible via
               Python bindings and common tools familiar to
               researchers and data scientists, as well as to be
               extensible such that new Federated Learning (FL),
               Multi-Party Computation, or Differential Privacy
               methods can be flexibly and simply implemented and
               integrated. This chapter will introduce the methods
               available within the PySyft library and describe their
               implementations. We will then provide a
               proof-of-concept demonstration of a FL workflow using
               an example of how to train a convolutional neural
               network. Next, we review the use of PySyft in academic
               literature to date and discuss future use-cases and
               development plans. Most importantly, we introduce Duet:
               our tool for easier FL for scientists and data
               owners.},
