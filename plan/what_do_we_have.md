# What do we have

Pipelined, user-friendly, customizable ML model deployment (and hopefully
benchmarking) on Android (and hopefully iOS) for FL,
where the ML models can be changed on the fly,
for rapid FL development iteration.

- Straightforward Android platform FL deployment with any TensorFlow model.
- Spawning Flower servers on demand using a persistent process.
- Changing ML models on the fly from the backend server.
- Comprehensive testing, telemetry, and benchmarking support.
- (Less relevant) FA with DP.
