# What do we have

Pipelined, user-friendly, customizable FL & FA platform for rapid ML model
deployment, iteration (and hopefully benchmarking) on Android (â†’ mobile).

- Straightforward Android platform (and iOS in the near future) FL deployment
    with any TensorFlow model.
- Spawning Flower servers for training on demand using a persistent process.
- Changing ML models on the fly from the backend server without app users'
    input.
- Comprehensive testing, telemetry, and benchmarking support (WIP).
- (Less relevant) FA with DP.
